# React Native TwitterSDK [Only iOS]
React Native TwitterSDK is a wrapper around the iOS Twitter SDK and Android Twitter SDK, allowing for Twitter integration in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps. Access to native components, from login to sharing, is provided entirely through documented JavaScript modules so you don't have to call a single native function directly.
